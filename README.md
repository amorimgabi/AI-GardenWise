# AI GardenWise
This project is part of the KaggleX Fellowship Program - Cohort-4.

AI Garden Wise is an intelligent chatbot to be developed with the support of the KaggleX fellowship to assist home and community gardeners in growing their own food. It should provide expert guidance on soil preparation, plant selection, watering, and pest control, along with nutritional insights and health benefits for various vegetables, herbs, and fruits. Powered by a fine-tuned Gemma model optimized with LoRA techniques and a specialized dataset, AI Garden Wise serves as a reliable and user-friendly tool for sustainable gardening practices.
